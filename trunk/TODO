-gpsd patchset:
	-make the emul code conditional.  that is, only build the
	 code if emul has been detected or user has requested it
	 with configure.  this is to get ready for merging with
	 the main gpsd branch.  also look for more ways to simply
	 the code and make it as non-obtrusive as possible.

-emul library:
	-compile and run test the library on a larger variety
	 of systems.
	-look into supporting multiple earthmate devices at
	 once.  gpsd has some multisession code for using
	 more than one unit.  this is to prepare for that.

-emul programs:
	-look into removing sirfmon utility, as the gpsd
	 package now ships with the ability to install the
	 tool.  the patchset will still support the sirfmon
	 utility.
