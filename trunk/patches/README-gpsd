	To apply the patch, copy or move the patch into the
gpsd-<version> directory.  Go ahead and change the user to root,
as we will soon be installing.  Before issuing the following
command, please make sure you are also in the gpsd directory:

$ patch < gpsd-<version>-emul.patch

The patch should apply cleanly... see below if it does not.

Next you will most likely need to run the following two commands:

$ aclocal && automake

(configure on gentoo fails without this):
$ libtoolize --copy --force

Then run the configure script to set up the daemon however you wish.
 (configure --help for options)

After this it should be sufficient to run:

$ make install

	If you recieve error messages and do not know how to resolve
them, please leave a bug report on the emul project page listed
further below.

	To test the install, issue the below command in a terminal:

$ gpsd -f emate -N

The 'N' option will cause the daemon to run in the foreground and
print output to the terminal as clients connect.  Then you can
simply telnet into the daemon via:

$ telnet localhost 2947
$ Trying 127.0.0.1...
$ Connected to localhost.
$ Escape character is '^]'.
 then issue the gpsd command 'r' to enable raw mode... nmea output
should appear.

or if you do not have telnet installed (insecure, etc), try running
xgps or some other client that was included with the gps daemon.
